# Insurance Risks & Claim Analysis Dashboard

A comprehensive Power BI solution that analyzes insurance claim patterns across demographics, vehicle attributes, geography, and socioeconomic segments.  
Built to help insurance companies identify high-risk groups, optimize pricing strategies, and improve underwriting accuracy.

---

## Project Overview
This dashboard provides a 360° view of **18,806 insurance policies**, highlighting total claim amounts, claim frequency, car-related risks, demographic behavior, and socioeconomic indicators.

With a total claim payout of **$93.77M**, the analysis identifies which customers, locations, vehicle types, and education groups drive the highest risk and cost—enabling data-driven premium decisions and targeted risk mitigation.

## Key Insights

### **1. Portfolio Summary**
- **Total Policies:** 18,806  
- **Total Claim Amount:** **$93.77M**  
- **Claim Frequency:** 0.51  
- **Average Claim Amount:** ~$5K  
- **Gender Split:** ~50/50 (balanced portfolio)

These metrics indicate a large, diverse customer base with moderate claim frequency and controlled average payouts.

---

### **2. Claim Insights by Car Attributes**
#### **Car Use**
- **Private Cars:** $75.13M (80% of claims)  
- **Commercial Cars:** $18.64M (20%)

Private vehicles dominate claim volume due to higher policy count, while commercial cars show higher severity per policy.

#### **Car Make**
Ford, Chevrolet, Toyota, GMC, and Dodge are the top contributors to total claims.  
Brands with broader market share naturally contribute higher claims but require model-level risk review.

#### **Car Year**
Older vehicles (1990s–early 2000s) show consistently higher claims.  
Newer models demonstrate fewer claims due to improved safety features.

---

### **3. Geographic Risk Insights**
Claim distribution is relatively even across zones:
- **Highly Urban:** 20.6%  
- **High Urban:** 20.27%  
- **Urban:** 19.5%  
- **Rural/Suburban:** ~20% each

Urban areas show slightly elevated claim severity due to higher traffic density.

---

### **4. Demographic & Socioeconomic Insights**
#### **Age Group**
Drivers aged **26–65** account for nearly 75% of total claim amounts.

#### **Kids Driving**
Households with teens or first-year drivers show extremely high claim amounts—one of the most critical risk segments.

#### **Education Level**
- **Bachelors:** $46.61M (50% of total claims)  
- **High School:** $26.08M  
- **Masters:** $14.16M  
- **PhD:** $6.33M  

Higher-educated customers tend to own higher-value vehicles and drive more, contributing larger claims.

#### **Education × Marital Status**
Single policyholders show consistently higher claim totals across nearly all education groups.

## Business Impact Summary
This analysis highlights multiple high-risk groups:
- New young drivers (kids driving)  
- Middle-aged drivers (26–65)  
- Singles vs married individuals  
- Urban/high-urban residents  
- Older vehicle models  
- High-volume makes like Ford and Chevrolet  

These insights allow insurers to refine pricing, improve risk scoring, and design proactive prevention programs to reduce future claim costs.

## Strategic Recommendations

### **Pricing & Underwriting**
- Adjust premiums for high-risk segments (urban zones, kids driving, older cars).  
- Increase deductibles for high-loss vehicle makes.  
- Introduce risk-based car-year pricing.

### **Risk Mitigation**
- Mandatory driver-education programs for teen drivers.  
- Incentive programs for safe driving (rewards, discounts).  
- Offer telematics-based policies to track driving behavior.

### **Customer Segmentation**
- Target Bachelors & middle-aged professionals for high-value policies.  
- Introduce budget policies in rural areas for market expansion.

### **Operational Enhancements**
- Use historical claim trends to forecast peak claim years.  
- Develop predictive risk models combining demographics + car data + geography.
